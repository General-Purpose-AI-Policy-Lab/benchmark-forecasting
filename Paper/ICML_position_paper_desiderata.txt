ICML POSITION PAPER — MAIN DESIDERATA (CHECKLIST)
(Compiled from ICML 2024–2026 position paper instructions and “position paper talk” guidelines.)

A) WHAT IT IS (HIGH-LEVEL INTENT)
[ ] The submission is a “position paper” (not a standard methods/empirical paper).
[ ] Primary goal: argue for a concrete, defensible position about what the ML community should do
    (research priorities, evaluation practice, norms, deployment/governance, etc.).
[ ] The paper is written to stimulate constructive discussion; reviewers need not agree with the stance.

B) CORE CONTENT REQUIREMENTS
1) Explicit position statement
[ ] A single clear, testable/normative position is stated unambiguously in the Introduction.
[ ] (Recommended/2026-style) The position statement is highlighted (e.g., bolded) for visibility.
[ ] The abstract identifies it as a position paper and states the position succinctly.

2) Evidence and reasoning (“scholarship”)
[ ] Claims are supported by evidence, reasoning, and citations (high scholarly standard).
[ ] Background/context is sufficient for ML audience; definitions are precise.
[ ] Distinguish clearly: facts vs. assumptions vs. speculation; note uncertainties/limitations.
[ ] Include relevant prior work; avoid strawman comparisons; cite opposing work fairly.

3) Alternatives / opposing views (critical requirement in recent guidance)
[ ] Include a dedicated “Alternative Views” (or equivalent) section in the MAIN PAPER BODY.
[ ] Present credible opposing positions (steelman them).
[ ] Address counterarguments: rebut, synthesize, or delimit scope (when the opposition is valid).
[ ] Make clear what evidence would change your mind (where applicable).

4) Actionability (strongly encouraged; explicit in 2026 criteria)
[ ] Include a “Call to Action” or equivalent: what steps should be taken, by whom.
[ ] Specify actors (e.g., researchers, benchmark designers, conference committees, labs, regulators).
[ ] Provide near-term and medium-term actions (and optionally timeline/roadmap).
[ ] Make recommendations operational (not just aspirational).

C) STRUCTURE / PRESENTATION
[ ] Title follows ICML position track conventions (recent years: begins with “Position:”).
[ ] Abstract: states it is a position paper and clearly summarizes the position.
[ ] Introduction: sets stakes + context + states the position early (recommended: in bold).
[ ] Body: develops argument logically (claims → support → implications → recommendations).
[ ] Include “Alternative Views” section in main body (not only appendix/supplement).
[ ] Optional but useful: “What would change my mind”, “Risks/downsides”, “Implementation details”.
[ ] Writing is accessible to broad ML audience; avoids unnecessary jargon; defines technical terms.
[ ] Use figures/tables only where they improve clarity for the argument (not novelty theater).

D) REVIEW / SUBMISSION POLICIES (DON’T FORGET)
(Exact policies vary slightly by year; check the current ICML call, but typical expectations below.)

[ ] Formatting: uses ICML style files and obeys page limits for the position paper track.
[ ] Double-blind compliance (where required): anonymization, no obvious self-identification.
[ ] Ethical disclosure norms: disclose conflicts, relevant affiliations, and limitations responsibly.
[ ] If impact statements / lay summaries are optional or not required for the track/year, do not assume;
    follow the current year’s instructions.
[ ] Any “exceptions” for the track (e.g., reciprocal reviewing requirement) are checked for the year.

E) “DISCUSSION-FIRST” OPTIMIZATION (VERY IMPORTANT IN PRACTICE)
[ ] The central argument is easy to restate in one sentence.
[ ] The most likely objections are anticipated and addressed fairly.
[ ] The paper invites engagement: clear open questions, “unknowns”, and concrete next steps.
[ ] Tone: rigorous, constructive, non-inflammatory; positions are argued, not asserted.
[ ] The paper is valuable even for readers who disagree with the conclusion.

F) QUALITY BAR (WHAT REVIEWERS LOOK FOR)
[ ] Clarity: position is unmistakable; contributions are understandable.
[ ] Credibility: arguments are sound; evidence is appropriate; citations are strong.
[ ] Novelty is not required as “new algorithm”; but the position must be non-trivial and insightful.
[ ] Usefulness: the position—if adopted—would improve the field’s trajectory.
[ ] Balance: acknowledges trade-offs and failure modes of proposed recommendations.

G) QUICK “PASS/FAIL” TESTS
[ ] Can a reader find the position in <30 seconds? (title/abstract/intro)
[ ] Is there a serious Alternative Views section?
[ ] Are there concrete actions with named stakeholders?
[ ] Would the paper still stand if a reviewer disagrees with the stance?
[ ] Is the writing oriented toward productive debate rather than persuasion-by-authority?
